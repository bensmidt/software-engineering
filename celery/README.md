## Tutorial: [Getting Started with Celery Tutorial (10 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THxCy-6EnQM)
To quickly get started with Celery, watch the video above by 
[Pretty Printed](https://www.youtube.com/@prettyprinted) and follow along with the 
README in the **redis_broker_redis_backend** directory. Alternatively, if you want 
to use RabbitMQ as the message broker instead of Redis, you can follow along with the 
README in the **rabbitmq_broker_redis_backend** directory.

## Installation
1. Install [DockerDesktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
1. Install the packages from the **requirements.txt** in the root directory
(I recommend use of a virtual environment like [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) but that's up to you, it's definitely not necessary)
1. Execute `pip3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory
